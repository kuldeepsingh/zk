# The 4 core values of Agile are:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

As sophisticated as technology gets, the human element will always serve as an important role in any kind of project management. Relying too heavily on processes and tools results in an inability to adapt to changing circumstances.

2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.

As important as documentation is, working software is more important. This value is all about giving the developers exactly what they need to get the job done, without overloading them.

3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

Your customers are one of your most powerful assets. Whether internal or external customers, involving them throughout the process can help to ensure that the end product meets their needs more effectively.

4. Responding to change over following a plan.

This value is one of the biggest departures from traditional project management. Historically, change was seen as an expense, and one to be avoided. Agile allows for continuous change throughout the life of any given project. Each sprint provides an opportunity for review and course correction.

# What are the 12 principles of Agile?

Agile methodologies can be as diverse and unique as each individual team. However, the 12 principles of Agile should always guide your decisions and product development.

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software (or whatever you deliver).
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
- Deliver projects frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
- Coordinating team members must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
- Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within different teams.
- The final product is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. All stakeholders should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Key Benefits of Agile Project Management:
Faster Time-to-Market:
Agile's iterative approach allows for rapid deployment of working software, getting value to customers sooner. 

Increased Customer Satisfaction:
Engaging customers throughout the development process leads to products that better meet their needs and expectations. 

Enhanced Flexibility and Adaptability:
Agile methodologies allow teams to quickly adapt to changing requirements and priorities. 

Improved Quality:
Frequent testing and feedback loops throughout the development cycle contribute to higher quality products. 

Better Visibility and Control:
Agile frameworks provide greater visibility into project progress, allowing for better risk management and control. 

Reduced Waste:
By focusing on delivering value incrementally, agile projects minimize wasted resources and effort. 

Enhanced Team Morale:
Agile's emphasis on collaboration and empowerment can boost team morale and productivity. 

Faster ROI:
Agile's faster time-to-market and improved product quality contribute to a faster return on investment. 

Improved Communication:
Agile promotes regular communication and feedback between team members, stakeholders, and customers. 

Continuous Improvement:
Agile encourages ongoing learning and improvement throughout the project lifecycle. 

Early Detection of Issues:
Agile's iterative approach allows for early detection of problems, enabling faster fixes and adjustments. 

Increased Collaboration:
Agile fosters collaboration among cross-functional teams, leading to better communication and understanding. 

Reduced Risks:
Agile's incremental approach and frequent feedback loops help identify and mitigate potential risks early on. 

Improved Project Predictability:
Agile's emphasis on regular planning and feedback provides greater visibility into project progress and allows for better predictions. 

More Freedom for Designers and Developers:
Agile allows for a more flexible approach to project management, allowing designers and developers to work in a way that best suits their strengths. 


## How do you handle people ?

“In networking systems, precision and reliability are non-negotiable—so how I handle people is rooted in setting high standards while creating a culture where engineers can focus and thrive.

I lead with clarity and empathy: I ensure every engineer and team knows not just the 'what', but the 'why' behind our work—whether it's optimizing BGP convergence, scaling data-plane throughput, or debugging kernel module issues.

I adapt my approach based on the person: senior engineers often want autonomy and vision alignment, while junior folks need mentorship and steady feedback. I hold regular 1:1s to stay connected, surface blockers, and provide coaching. I also make sure that cross-team collaboration—say, between control plane and platform teams—is frictionless and respectful.

In a past role, for instance, I noticed friction between protocol devs and QA during tight release windows. I created shared objectives, streamlined pre-release checklists, and assigned leads who could escalate quickly. That change improved both team morale and our release velocity.

I’m also proactive about growth—I encourage engineers to publish RFCs internally, lead tech reviews, or own initiatives like automating route validation with FRR or integrating VPP for fast-path forwarding.

Ultimately, I handle people by ensuring they’re aligned to a clear purpose, supported in their growth, and held accountable in a respectful, outcome-focused environment. In networking systems, that balance is what ensures technical excellence and team resilience.”
